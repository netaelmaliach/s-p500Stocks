# s-p500Stocks

In this project i used yfinance to download historical stock trading data of all the
stocks that are currently on the S&P Index. The data contains the daily price
change in an OHLCV (Open-High-Low-Close-Volume).
The goal is to Process the original data to create a feature set that will provide information gain for a
classifier model that will be based on these features.
